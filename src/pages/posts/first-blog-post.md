This is my first blog post. 

# Creating My Website 

If you take a peek at the [repository of this website](https://github.com/alexwkleung/alexwkleung-website), it is created with Astro. Initially my website was created in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I didn't want to salvage it further, so that's why I never made it public.

I think it was worth rewriting my website in Astro since the learning curve isn't too difficult for a site like this. The sources I used were the [Astro blog tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/), [AqingCyan's website](https://www.aqingcyan.me/), and the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/). I took heavy design inspiration from AqingCyan's website because it aligned with what I wanted: clean and simple.

You may have noticed that the minimal blog template [Lilian](https://github.com/alexwkleung/Lilian) I created a few months ago has some resemblance, so that's when I initially took the design inspiration from. I looked at a handful of blog designs but I always went back to AqingCyan's because that's what I liked the most.

*Small note:* I don't recommend users to use Lilian as their main blog template. It was really just a project to learn how to create a blog from scratch. If you want a decent blog template, you can fork/clone this website.

# Blog Writing

Having an internet trail in a form of a blog attached to your name *can* be scary. Despite being posted on your own website, you need to make sure the posted content isn't going to come back and haunt you in the future.

To be honest, I hope that writing blog posts will help with my fear of sharing things on the internet. Of course, I will carefully analyze the content I post so there will be less misconceptions.
